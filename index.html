        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Basaveshwar Engineering College. We provide quality education with excellent infrastructure and
            experienced faculty.</p>
        <p>Basaveshwar Engineering College was established in 1963. Our mission is to develop skilled engineers with strong ethical values. Basaveshwar Engineering College (BEC), Bagaikot is undergoing unswerving growth since 1963. It started as a private institute with only three Engineering programs viz. Civil, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering and came into Government grant in-aid code from 1968.
             Today, the institute offers 9 undergraduate and 8 post graduate programmes with 10 departments recognized as R&D centers by VTU, Belagavi. It is a matter of pride for BEC to be placed in the rank band of 201-250 at all India level for the year 2019-20 by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of MHRD, New Delhi. The growth of institution can be pigeon-holed into three phases as it has undergone enormous change from 1963 till date. The main focus during phase-I (1963 to 1983) was consolidation and strengthening of the basic infrastructure facilities to achieve academic excellence.</p>


    <p>
        Basaveshwar Engineering College, Bagalkot offers a comprehensive range of
        undergraduate, postgraduate, diploma, and skill-based programs designed
        to meet the evolving demands of industry, research, and society.
        The academic programs are structured to provide a strong theoretical
        foundation, hands-on practical exposure, interdisciplinary learning,
        and professional competence.
    </p>

    <p>
        The institution follows an outcome-based education framework that focuses
        not only on academic excellence but also on critical thinking, ethical
        responsibility, innovation, and lifelong learning. Each program is
        periodically reviewed and updated to align with emerging technologies,
        industry trends, and national education standards.
